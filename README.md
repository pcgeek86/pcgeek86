## Hello, I'm Trevor Sullivan 👋🏻

I've been working in the software industry since early 2004.
The technologies I have worked with include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), PowerShell, Python, JavaScript, MySQL, GitHub, Kubernetes, and many others. 
Over the years, I have produced many videos on [my YouTube channel 📺](https://youtube.com/trevorsullivan), especially around cloud and automation topics.

I'm building a new documentation website, with a focus on open source tools, at https://notes.opensrc.dev.
This website is being build out using a new JavaScript framework, based on Next.js, called [Dendron 🌱](https://dendron.so).
