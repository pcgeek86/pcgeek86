## Hello, I'm Trevor Sullivan 👋🏻

I've been working in the software industry since early 2004.
The technologies I have worked with include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), PowerShell, Python, JavaScript, MySQL, GitHub, Kubernetes, and many others. 
Over the years, I have produced many videos on [my YouTube channel 📺](https://youtube.com/trevorsullivan), especially around cloud and automation topics.

I'm building a new documentation website, with a focus on open source tools, at https://notes.opensrc.dev.
This website is being built out using a new JavaScript framework, based on Next.js, called [Dendron 🌱](https://dendron.so).
My objective is to share unique tips and tricks to help people be more productive in software development and deployment.

On social media, you can [find me on LinkedIn 👨🏻‍🚀](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-sullivan-310000225/).

## Training Content at CBT Nuggets 🎥

I've worked at CBT Nuggets as a software trainer, starting in April 2020. 
During my time there, I've produced a significant amount of training content, north of 200+ hours.
The topics I've built training on include: PowerShell, AWS, Azure, GitHub, MySQL, and Kubernetes. ☁️
One of the great things about IT training with CBT Nuggets is that we offer a quizzing platform, to test your newfound technical knowledge.

- My [AWS Cloud Automation course](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/aws/cloud-automation) ☁️ alone has 96 hours of PowerShell and Python content.
- The [MySQL Essentials training course](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/programming-and-development/my-sql-essentials) has 25+ hours of video content.
- My [GitHub training course](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/programming-and-development/github) offers 20+ hours of training, and covers many use cases for GitHub Actions automation. ⌨️
- [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/cbt-nuggets/new-course-certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka) training will boost your Kubernetes skills! 🚢

When I produce content for CBT Nuggets, or my YouTube channel, my primary objective is to promote knowledge that other people can use in their own environments.
I genuinely hope that people who see my videos, read my articles, or use my open source tools, will experience less friction in their software journey.
