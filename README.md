## Hello, I'm Trevor Sullivan 👋🏻

I've been working in the software industry since early 2004.
The technologies I have worked with include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), PowerShell, Golang, Python, JavaScript, MySQL, GitHub, Kubernetes, and many others. 
Over the years, I have produced many videos on [my YouTube channel 📺](https://youtube.com/trevorsullivan), especially around cloud and automation topics.

I'm building a new documentation website, with a focus on open source tools, at https://docs.opensrc.dev.
This website is being built out using the [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) JavaScript framework.
My objective is to share unique tips and tricks to help people be more productive in software development and deployment.

On social media, you can [find me on LinkedIn 👨🏻‍🚀](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-sullivan-310000225/).

When I produce content for my followers, my primary objective is to promote knowledge that other people can use in their own environments.
I genuinely hope that people who see my videos, read my articles, or use my open source tools, will experience less friction in their software journey.
