## Hello, I'm Trevor Sullivan 👋🏻

I've been working in the software industry since early 2004.
The technologies I have worked with include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), PowerShell, Python, JavaScript, MySQL, GitHub, Kubernetes, and many others. 
Over the years, I have produced many videos on [my YouTube channel 📺](https://youtube.com/trevorsullivan), especially around cloud and automation topics.

I'm building a new documentation website, with a focus on open source tools, at https://notes.opensrc.dev.
This website is being build out using a new JavaScript framework, based on Next.js, called [Dendron 🌱](https://dendron.so).

On social media, you can [find me on LinkedIn 👨🏻‍🚀](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-sullivan-310000225/).

## Training Content at CBT Nuggets

I've worked at CBT Nuggets as a software trainer, starting in April 2020. 
During my time there, I've produced a significant amount of training content, north of 150+ hours.
The topics I've built training on include: PowerShell, AWS, Azure, GitHub, MySQL, and Kubernetes. 
My [AWS Cloud Automation course](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/aws/cloud-automation) alone has 96 hours of PowerShell and Python content.
